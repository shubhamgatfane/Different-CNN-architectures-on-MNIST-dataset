# Different-CNN-architectures-on-MNIST-dataset
The MNIST is a large dataset of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The task was to classify the handwritten images belong to each of the ten classes. Used categorical cross-entropy and accuracy as a metric. Tried various CNN architectures to classify given image by changing different parameters like a dropout, the number of hidden layers, batch normalization, max-pooling using stride and pool size 2*2, activation functions like Relu, tan-h, sigmoid, softmax. Got 99.51% accuracy with 0.02 validation loss using Adadelta optimizer.
